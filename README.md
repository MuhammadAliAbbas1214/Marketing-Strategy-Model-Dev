# Marketing-Strategy-Model-Dev
My first industry experience:
During my Internship at KPMG Australia, I learned to Clean, Analyse, and Process data and finally develop a Model for the Client project where the requirement was to develop a marketing strategy using the dataset and training it thru a model. The highlights have been shared as a pdf file.
